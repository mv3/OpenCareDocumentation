      <article>
        <p>This application uses 3 user roles:</p>  
        <ul>
          <li>
            Parent
          </li>
          <li>Teacher</li>
          <li>
            Administrator
          </li>
        </ul>

    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Parents">
      <header>Parents</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          Parent is the most restricted role.
        </p>  
        <p>
          When parents sign in, they are brought to the student list page where they see a 
          list of all of their children currently registered. Parents can sign their children 
          in for the day, edit their personal information, or view their detail page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each child is a assigned to one parent account. A child has an enrollment status of Enrolled, 
          Not Enrolled, or Pending. This status is set by an Administrator. An administrator may also assign 
          a child to a group.
        </p>

        <p>
            When teachers log in they are taken to the Student list page similarly to parents. However, 
            they will see a list of students assigned to the group that they teach and only have access 
            to view the enrollment status and sign-in status as well as access to the detail page. 
          </p>    
          <p>
            If a teacher is also a parent, they will see a second list similar to when parents log in. 
            They have all of the same access to their children that parents do.
          </p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Administrators">
      <header>Administrators</header>
      <p>
        Administrators have the highest level of access. An administrator may also 
        be a teacher and/or a parent.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to having all of the access of parents and teachers, administrators also have 
        access to the Admin menu where they can add new users and assign their role. Additionally 
        Administrators can manage groups and assign teachers and students to groups.

        New Users can be registered two ways:
        <p>
          By filling out the registration page:
          <img src="img/register.png" alt="Register" style="width:50%">
        </p>
        <p>
          Or by an administrator:
          <img src="img/adminregister.png" alt="Register" style="width:50%">
        </p>
        <p>
          User who self register will be defaulted to the Parent role. Users registered by an Admin 
          may be assigned to any role.

            Administarators can see all registered students. They may edit their 
            information, view the detail page, or delete students.

        </p>  
        <p>
            Teachers see a list of all students enrolled in their group. If the teacher 
            is also a parent they will see a second list of their children.
            <img src="img/teacherstudentlist.png" alt="Students" style="width:50%">
        </p>
            Parents see only a list of their children.

          The Student Detail page displays information about the student including: 
          <ul>
            <li>Personal Information</li>
            <li>Documents, such as medical records and accident reports.</li>
            <li>Daily information</li>
          </ul>
        </p>  
        <p>
          Document files can uploaded, stored in the database, and downloaded by selecting the link. 
          The daily information includes Sign-ins, Diaper Changes, Bottles, and notes. 
          Only information for the current day is displayed, but clicking more allows the 
          user to view all past records.
        </p>

        <p>
            Administrators may accept or reject a students enrollment from this page. 
            Documents, Diaper changes, Bottles, and Notes may be added by 
            Administrators, Teachers, or Parents. This allows parents to view what has 
            occured while the child is at school, but also gives them the opportunity 
            to give teachers information about their child's activities outside of school.

        <p>
          The Users list page displays all registered users. The administrator can register 
          new users or edit, view, and delete existing users. From the detail page, the 
          administator can see a list of a parent's children and a teacher's students. 
          When a parent is deleted, all children are also deleted.
